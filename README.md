# Situated Soundscaping
This repository will contain the most up-to-date progress of the Situated Soundscaping project.

The Situated Soundscaping project is focussed towards enabling hearing aid users to be in control of their hearing aid algorithm. The user should be able to record a short fragment of the sound that he or she perceives and decide whether this sound needs to be amplified or surpressed. 

The speech data set used for this project has been retrieved from https://www.openslr.org/12 and represents 100 hours of cleaned speech recordings. The noise data set has been obtained from http://www.eduardofonseca.net/FSDnoisy18k/#download.
